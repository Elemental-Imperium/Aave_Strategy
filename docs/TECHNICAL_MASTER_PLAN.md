# Technical Master Plan for the Aave Strategy Project

## **Project Overview**

The Aave Strategy Project aims to develop a secure, scalable, and user-friendly platform for implementing borrowing and lending strategies using stablecoins and AI-driven assistance. The platform will integrate blockchain technology, OpenAI APIs, and modern web development tools to provide a seamless user experience.

---

## **Core Features**

1. **AI Integration**:
   - Use OpenAI’s API to generate and refine strategies based on user inputs.
   - Provide real-time suggestions for borrowing percentages, collateral ratios, and loops.

2. **Blockchain Integration**:
   - Interact with Aave’s smart contracts to execute borrowing and lending strategies.
   - Deploy and manage custom smart contracts for advanced functionality.

3. **Web-Based Interface**:
   - A React-based frontend powered by Vite for fast builds and development.
   - A Node.js backend for API logic and database interactions.

4. **Monitoring and Automation**:
   - Real-time monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana.
   - Automated deployment and testing scripts.

## **Architecture Design**

### **1. Frontend (React + Vite)**

- **Framework**: React.js with Vite for fast HMR (Hot Module Replacement).
- **UI Libraries**: Tailwind CSS for styling, Chart.js for data visualization.
- **Key Features**:
  - User authentication and wallet connection (MetaMask, WalletConnect).
  - Dashboard for real-time strategy metrics (Health Factor, LTV, Net Profit).
  - AI chat interface for strategy generation.

### **2. Backend (Node.js)**

- **Framework**: Express.js for API routing.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for storing user data, strategy configurations, and logs.
- **Key Features**:
  - AI API requests (OpenAI integration).
  - Smart contract interaction via Ethers.js.
  - Prometheus metrics endpoint for monitoring.

### **3. Blockchain**

- **Tools**: Hardhat for smart contract development, Infura/Alchemy for Ethereum and Polygon RPC endpoints.
- **Key Features**:
  - Deploy custom smart contracts to manage user strategies.
  - Interact with Aave’s lending pools and governance contracts.

### **4. Monitoring Tools**

- **Prometheus**:
  - Collect metrics such as API response times, blockchain transaction statuses, and system performance.
- **Grafana**:
  - Display metrics in interactive dashboards.
  - Set up alerts for critical events (e.g., health factor < 1).
